Prediction Assignment
=====================

Course project for "Practical Machine Learning" class on Coursera

Goal
====

The course website asked students to do the following (paraphrased):
1) Use the training set to predict the "classe" variable.
2) Create a report detailing how the model was built, how cross validation was used, the expected out of sample error, and give reasons for the chosen models.
3) Use the prediction model to predict 20 test cases.

The submission itself wanted the following (paraphrased):
1. Submit a Github repo with R markdown and compiled HTML file.
2. The writeup should be less than 2000 words and the number of figures needs to be less than 5.
3. (Optional) Submit a repo with a gh-pages branch.
4. Submit the answers to the 20 test cases on the appropriate course webpage.

Tools Learned
=============

The main tool used which gave strong results was randomForest. Furthermore, it was important to call randomForest in the right way in order to run quickly (a matter of milliseconds or seconds) as opposed to running slowly (a matter of hours or days).

I learned other tools as well, but will have to update this README at another time.
